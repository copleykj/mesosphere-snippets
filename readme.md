# Mesosphere Snippets
A collection of snippets that are useful when working with **Mesosphere**. Currently there are only Sublime Text 2 snippets since that is what I mainly edit in. If you have favorite editor that is extensible, please feel free to contribute them.

## Sublime Text 2 Snippets
* Main Mesosphere() function for describing your form.
* Mesosphere.registerRule
* Mesosphere.registerFormat
* Mesosphere.registerTransform
* Mesosphere.registerAggregate
